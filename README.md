typeof null is object
typeof undefined is undefined 

when we convert "33" into a number then successfully convert in 33 [Number("33")]
but, when we converted "33abc" into a number it also converted successfully but converted in NaN (Not a Number) 
If converted  null in Number then it converted to zero.
converted undefined in Number then also give undefined.
